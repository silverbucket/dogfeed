**Dogfeed is currently not being maintained and is in a non-functional state. Total rewrite planned in the future.**

## About

Dogfeed is being developed as a proof-of-concept app for [Sockethub](http://sockethub.org).

It is designed to be fully [Unhosted](http://unhosted.org), relying on Sockethub for it's server-side functionality, and [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io), for it's data storage.


## Use

Dogfeed is available for use at [dogfeed.5apps.com](https://dogfeed.5apps.com)

By default it is configured to use the default Sockethub instance hosted at [silverbucket.net](https://silverbucket.net), however in the settings you are able to change this to use any Sockethub instance you prefer, including your own.


## Current Status

**Stable**

Dogfeed is currently released as a stable web-application, though there are still known bugs and ongoing work being done to improve the overall experience, and add useful features.
